# javascript
my javascript projects

This repo will store my future javascript projects. I've recently finished Sololearn's Javascript tutorial course and I am learning JavaScript on https://www.codecademy.com/ (currently at the Iterators chapter) and https://watchandcode.com/.

I consider myself a coding beginner (although I did do some programming in Pascal and C++ in high school, as well as in C# during the QA course from not too long ago), so any help is welcome!

Thank you!
